        <h1><b>WELCOME <br>TO<br><b>MY WEBSITE</h1></p>
<p>Welcome to my first foray into web development! As a third-year B.Tech student, I've recently delved into the captivating world of front-end development, crafting my initial website using HTML and CSS. This project serves as a tangible expression of my newfound love for transforming code into visually appealing interfaces. Through hours of exploration, trial, and error, I've embraced the challenges and victories that come with designing a simple yet meaningful website. This venture signifies not just a collection of lines of code but a journey of learning, where each element tells a story of perseverance and growth. As I share this humble creation with you, 
it's an open invitation to witness the beginning of my coding odyssey, where passion meets pixels, and the excitement for what lies ahead in the vast landscape of front-end development is palpable.
